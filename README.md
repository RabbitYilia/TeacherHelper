My teacher always forget to copy files for course to PC in classroom.

Let me help my Teacher to do this. LOL

## Function

If my teacher open some files with word or pdf reader,get the path of the file then copy file to Local disk.

The classmate will never feel headache to ask teacher for files.

## Todo

- Write in Go
- Use the method to monitor file handler instead of command line.
- More stable
